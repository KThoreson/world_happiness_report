# world_happiness_report
This is the journey through my analysis of the World Happiness Report as my Capstone Project for my Google Data Analytics Certificate.

I initially loaded the data set into Sheets as the size of the files were permitting. I created a directory and uploaded the .csv files. I opened and examined each one. With a clear and present schema I cleaned and validated the data to ensure it had a consistent and uniform structure.

I did an introductory analysis of this dataset in sheets as the size of the .csv permitted. I made a table consisting of the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of each of the table metrics.

I created histograms to display where the results from the new table lied on the bell curve. I made graphs of each of the facets of the report and the happiness score itself to show correlation.

I repeated this process in SQL and Tableau and this is the culmination of those findings and the utilitarian tool that is R.

This landmark survey conducted by Gallup World Poll was looking for additional factors other than monetary that influence the wellbeing of the populace. Experts in several fields came together to decide on these metrics and interviewed a sampling of the population of participating countries and asked them to rank these facets in their lives from 0 being the worst to 10 being the best. These facets do not incorporate into the happiness score itself so I am investigating the data for correlations in these areas and happiness.
